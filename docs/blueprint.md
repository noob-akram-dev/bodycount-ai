# **App Name**: BodyCount AI

## Core Features:

- Username Entry: Allow a user to enter a username for the target individual.
- Body Count Generation: Generate a fictional 'body count' based on the username, giving higher random bodycount if religious lines are detected in the bio. Uses a tool to determine when and how various parameters related to violence should affect the generated 'body count'.
- Body Count Display: Display the generated 'body count' in a visually prominent way.
- Disclaimer: Always display a disclaimer stating that the app generates fictional numbers for entertainment purposes only.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Tinder's coral red (#FF6B6B) for a bold and attention-grabbing feel.
- Secondary color: Light pink (#F4D1D1) to complement the primary color.
- Background color: White (#FFFFFF) for a clean and modern look.
- Body and headline font: 'Helvetica Neue' or a similar sans-serif font for readability and a modern aesthetic.
- Use minimalistic icons in white or light gray to maintain a clean look.
- Simple, single-column layout with clear sections for username entry and result display, mirroring Tinder's card-based design.
- Subtle animations during 'body count' generation to maintain user engagement, such as a pulsating effect or a smooth transition.
